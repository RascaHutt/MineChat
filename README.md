MineChat
========
Minechat is an awesome plugin for bukkit that allows you to talk to
people from an external webpage. If you want a plugin that does this, without having to go
through countless surveys (that don't even work), then this is the plugin for you.

It has all been coded by hand. No automatic coding machines have been used at all. This shows
the type of hardwork people have put into this. So subscribe to "mhutti1" on Youtube if you can.
It would be nice.

This is going to be the first of many programs that we will create, So look out for more.
